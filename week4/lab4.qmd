# lab notes

general note: scaterplots show correlations/trends

Grid lines
pro: allows you to see the vLues
allows for easier pairwise comparisons for a particular value. 

con: can make it messy
better for general trends to not have them!
without, encourages "big picture" thinking

"the simpler your message the more minimalist you can be"

"as your message gets more complex, the more help you need" more gridlines, borders

# Backgrounds

theme_gray and theme_dark: better for lighter and brighter point colors
light backgrounds typically more clear when your colors dont need it!

by removing gridlines you lose specific values
but if looking at general trend "there is a negative relationship" then theme_classic with no grid lines is more advantageous

If you like having gridlines can adjust transparency to have them be faint, for those who want it!
